README
This is super under construction. Trying to note program functionality as I build it.

Category Creation:
Categories are stored in the /config/CATEGORIES.txt file
To manually add a category, type the desired name in a new line in that file.
Upon starting, the program checks the directory and config files for each
If there is no directory for that category, it will create one and copy a default color profile to it
